**Remarkability** provides beautiful and accessible styles for the content generated by the rich-text editors in a CMS or from a markdown file. It comes with sensible defaults that can be customized using [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/).

## Get started

##### Using NPM or Yarn

Add to your project with NPM or Yarn.

```sh
npm install @microflash/remarkability
yarn add @microflash/remarkability
```

This is the recommended way if you want to customize **Remarkability** using Sass.

##### Using CDN

Add one of the following `<link>` elements in the `<head>` of your HTML document.

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/@microflash/remarkability">
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@microflash/remarkability">
```

> By default, these CDNs will serve the latest published version. Refer to the [unpkg](https://unpkg.com/) / [jsDelivr](https://www.jsdelivr.com/features) docs for other possible ways to get **Remarkability**.

##### Download

You can also download the [latest version](https://github.com/Microflash/remarkability/releases/latest) or [browse the previous releases](https://github.com/Microflash/remarkability/releases) on GitHub.

## Usage

Just add `.remarkability` class to your container to style the elements within.

```html
<article class="remarkability">
  <!-- HTML content -->
</article>
```

By default, **Remarkability** inherits colors and typography from the parent element but you can customize this behavior with [Sass](https://github.com/Microflash/remarkability/tree/master/packages/library/scss).

##### Global variant

If you want to use **Remarkability** globally, a [global variant](https://github.com/Microflash/remarkability/blob/master/packages/library/scss/remarkability.global.scss) is also available; it doesn't scope the styles under the `.remarkability` class.
