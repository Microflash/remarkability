## Code of Conduct

All the participations for Remarkability are governed by [Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Guidelines

### Objectives

Remarkability has the following objectives:

1. **Readability**
2. **Accessibility**
3. **Simplicity**
4. **Extensibility**

### Git Commits

- Use the present tense, e.g., `add status badges`, not `added status badges`
- Use lowercase, except when to emphasize or when a name can't be used in lowercase.
- Use the imperative mood, e.g., `tweak postcss configuration`, not `tweaks postcss configuration`
- Prefix the commits with a type, which consists of a noun, `feat`, `fix`, `chore`, etc.
- Provide a scope to describe a section of codebase surrounded by parenthesis, e.g., `fix(ci)`
- Use the type `feat` when a commit adds a new feature.
- Use the type `fix` when a commit represents a bug fix.
- Use the type `chore` when a commit represents anything else and provide the scope to clarify the context of commit, e.g., `chore(deps)`
- Provide a description after adding a colon and a space after the type/scope prefix, e.g., `chore(deps): switch to dart-sass`
- Optionally, provide a long description in the commit body, which begins one blank line after the description.
- Indicate a breaking change by adding a `!` immediately before the `:`, e.g., `chore!: prepare v0.7.0`
